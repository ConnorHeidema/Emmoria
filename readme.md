# Setup

1. Open a terminal and run `sudo mongod --dbpath /media/connor/DATA/Documents/db` to open a database
2. run `make mode=DEBUG` to build the executable (you can also use INFO, WARNING, or ERROR)
3. run `./output/emmoria` to start the game

Currently the database is locked onto my own computer.
